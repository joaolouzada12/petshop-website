# 🐾 Pet Shop Landing Page

This is a simple landing page for a fictional pet shop. It was one of my first HTML and CSS projects, built to practice layout, styling, and responsive design. Even though it's an old project, I decided to bring it to my portfolio to show my evolution and dedication from the beginning.

## 🚀 Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Responsive Design (Media Queries)
- JavaScript

## 🎯 Purpose
This page simulates a basic business site with sections like:
- Hero section with logo and banner
- Service highlights
- Brand logos
- Map with location
- Social media and footer

## ✏️ Notes
I recently updated the project to use semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` and made small improvements for better structure and responsiveness, without changing its original style.
